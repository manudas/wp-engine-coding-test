WP Engine "Coding Exercise"
Introduction

At WP Engine, building great solutions to problems is part of our culture. We've designed this exercise to allow you to demonstrate your excellent problem-solving abilities. Please produce a user interface that demonstrates work you would be proud to share.

One of our core values at WP Engine is "Do The Right Thing". In order to have a hiring process that is as fair as possible we do a "blind" review of this exercise. Please refrain from including your name, email address, GitHub username, etc. in your code and documentation.
Problem Statement

The goal of this coding exercise is to create a React app that uses the Reddit API to display a given subreddit's posts.

    Provide a UI that allows a user to enter a subreddit (i.e. reactjs - https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs.json)

    When the UI receives the subreddit, display the most recent posts

    The UI should only show 10 posts at a time with the ability to move forward/backward through the list of posts

In order to test your code, provide instructions in your README.md on how to compile, run, and test your code.
